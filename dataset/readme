The proposed framework PICNet is trained by employing the NCT-CRC-HE-100K histopathology dataset . 
After processing, 24,000 measured intensity images and 5,098 object phase images at a spatial resolution of $224 \times 224$ pixels are obtained.
Notably, the dataset encompasses diverse biological tissue types, including smooth muscle, normal colon mucosa, and lymphocytes.
