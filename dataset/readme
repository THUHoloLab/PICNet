The proposed framework PICNet is trained by employing the NCT-CRC-HE-100K histopathology dataset, which can be downloaded in "https://zenodo.org/records/1214456". 
After processing, 24,000 measured intensity images and 5,098 object phase images at a spatial resolution of 224 × 224 pixels are obtained.
The dataset encompasses diverse biological tissue types, including smooth muscle, normal colon mucosa, and lymphocytes.
